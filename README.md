# pumkin_patch

A mod that adds some fantasy style items, blocks, mobs and other random stuff to minecraft,
specifically made for the private Pumpkin Patch SMP server!

If you have any suggestions let me know!

### Features

- Dwarven Dynamite: 
  - Block that works as tnt but with a bigger boom and destroys obsidian.
- Fairy Powder (Will be renamed probably)
  - Powder that can be thrown and gives levitation and slowfalling to nearby entities.


### Future Plans

- Explorer dimension which resets every x time (same generation as Overworld)
- Add the pumpkin Patch datapack to the mod
